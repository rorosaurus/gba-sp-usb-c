AGS USB Type C Mod Bezel by makho on Thingiverse: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4123563

Summary
This file was created by BlindEye but it needed some tweaks to fit without having to mod it once printed. I made those tweaks.

I'm rehosting without his permission but since his store is abandoned and he does not reply to PMs, I don't really know what else to do. I'm sure it's fine.

Here are the PCBs that BlindEye made for this mod:

And these are the USB C ports that are needed:

Here is the install and a bit more info about the mod:

tl;dw, this is a mod for replacing the original, proprietary port with a USB Type C port for charging only. This mod will NOT allow for charging on a USB Type C host device and will ONLY work with a Type A -> Type C cable. Type C -> Type C will not work. I'm (eventually) going to redesigned the adapter to fix that but for now this is BlindEye's version.
