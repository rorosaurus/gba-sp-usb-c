## The truly universal USB-C dream is finally realized for your Game Boy Advance SP!

*(Also compatible with the original Nintendo DS!)*

Charge your Game Boy Advance SP with USB-C, using any USB-C cable and charger! If it fits, it'll charge! Finally you can stop carrying around that extra proprietary cable!

My design is based off [this existing PCB](https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/I6UOH6gb) that only works with ````USB-A -> USB-C```` cables. In my opinion, if you're gonna future-proof your Game Boy, you shouldn't remain reliant on Type-A!

My PCB works with ````USB-C <-> USB-C```` cables as well, so you can use ANY USB-C cable/charger to charge it! I've also verified it works with ````USB-A -> USB-C```` cables, Quick Charge, and USB-PD! That means if your charger or USB battery pack offers 5V/9V/12V/etc., it will recognize the Game Boy can only accept 5V and charge accordingly.

# Options

To reduce confusion and simplify filling orders, I've consolidated the options into just one offering which satisfies 70% of orders. I go into [a bit more detail here.](https://github.com/rorosaurus/gba-sp-usb-c/blob/master/why-sell-on-amazon.md)

I will assemble the components for you before shipping. You only have to desolder the exisiting charging port, then solder 3 points to attach to your Game Boy!

I will include a small 3D printed part to fill in the gap in the case created by the smaller USB-C port. It will friciton-fit snugly, or you can use glue/epoxy to keep it in place. Some post-processing (sanding) might be necessary for the cleanest look.

# Compatibility

This design works for the AGS-001 and AGS-101.

This design is compatible with [3.5mm headphone jack mods](https://github.com/rorosaurus/gba-sp-headphone-jack)! That means my PCB will not block the other pins you need from the default charging port pads on the Game Boy's motherboard.

It also works on the original (fat) Nintendo DS, NTR-001. Now your Phat GBA Macro can use USB-C as well!
